# Vue Typescript Electron Starter Kit

This starter kit provide a boilerplate to getting started with Electron, Vuejs, and Typescript.

## Notice !

I'm not providing support for Tests yet and some dependencies is not in production ready (eg. some webpack@4.x plugins is still in beta), so don't use at production or use at your own risk.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or Download this repo
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn serve`

## What is inside ?

I use webpack@4 for module bundler, Vue SPA related modules (vue-router, vuex), Typescript as Language, Vue Class Style Component, Tailwindcss, Lodash, and some bundling related modules.
